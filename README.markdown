# FlickrPlus Safari Extension

The **[FlickrPlus](http://robwilkerson.org/_resources/projects/safari/extensions/FlickrPlus.safariextz)** extension adds a collection of links to the Flickr photo page sidebar. The links provide quick access to Flickr actions such as viewing an image on a black background, obtaining its short URL, seeing all sizes of the image, and more.

## Installation

1. Download the [compiled extension](http://robwilkerson.org/_resources/projects/safari/extensions/FlickrPlus.safariextz).

    **NOTE:** The links should work, but if you're sent to a page of jibberish, you may have to right click (or option-click) and select one of the "Download Linked File" options.

1. Double click the downloaded file to install.
